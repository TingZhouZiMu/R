# WHAT IS R?

R is a programming language and environment for statistical computing and graphics. The software is free and open-source.

R provides wide variety of statistical and graphical techniques, and is highly extensible (i.e. designed so that users or developers can expand or add to its capabilities). There are many user written packages. 

The following is pulled from the "About R" section of the R Project's website (https://www.r-project.org/about.html)

R is an integrated suite of software facilities for data manipulation, calculation and graphical display. It includes an effective data handling and storage facility, a suite of operators for calculations on arrays, in particular matrices, a large, coherent, integrated collection of intermediate tools for data analysis, graphical facilities for data analysis and display either on-screen or on hardcopy, and a well-developed, simple and effective programming language which includes conditionals, loops, user-defined recursive functions and input and output facilities.
